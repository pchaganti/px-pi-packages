## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.4] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- `/synthetic-models` now shows the catalog's advertised reasoning-effort values in the selected model details.

### Changed
- Live model discovery now derives exact pi thinking levels from each row's `reasoning_parameters.efforts`, including `syn:*` permalinks and newly added reasoning models. Known pinned models retain hardcoded effort snapshots for startup fallback when the catalog is unavailable; offline permalinks still fail closed because their targets can rotate.
- Refreshed hardcoded reasoning-effort snapshots from the authenticated catalog, including enabling catalog-advertised controls for GPT OSS 120B.

### Fixed
- Corrected Kimi K3's thinking levels to its documented and catalog-advertised `low`, `high`, and `max` values. K3 always reasons, so `off` is no longer selectable; the unsupported `none` and `medium` values are no longer sent.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- Fixed console writes corrupting the frame in pi 0.84's fullscreen TUI, whose renderer repaints differentially and never clears stray output. The missing-API-key notice at `session_start` now routes through the extension UI when one is attached; headless output is unchanged. This notice fires on the exact configuration a new user hits, so it was the most visible instance.
- Removed the redundant `console.error` calls in the `/synthetic-models` and `/synthetic-quota` handlers. Both sat after a `ctx.ui.notify` carrying the same message and behind an early return on `!ctx.hasUI`, so they only ever ran with a UI attached.

### Changed
- `FetchSyntheticModelsOptions` gains an optional `notify` callback so the `session_start` refetch reports fallback diagnostics through the UI. The extension-load call runs before the TUI starts and keeps the console defaults, so omitting it preserves existing behavior.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- Added `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3` to fallback models with thinking-level support, verified against live `reasoning_effort` probes: `off` → `none`, `medium` → `medium`, `high` → `high`, `xhigh` → `max`. Unlike Kimi-K2.7-Code, K3 returns clean content at `none` and `low` rather than leaking raw thinking tags, so `off` is selectable. `low`/`minimal` stay hidden because the provider-side `low` value disables reasoning outright, matching the treatment of the other reasoning models.

### Changed
- Permalink resolution fails closed. An unknown, absent, or already-prefixed `hugging_face_id`, or a row whose explicit `supported_features` omits `reasoning`, yields the shared compat and emits no `reasoning_effort` at all — sending a value the backend rejects fails the entire request, which is worse than running at the default effort. The alias row's own capability list outranks its target's probed map.
- `getSyntheticModelOverrides` takes an optional second `SyntheticModel` argument. Existing single-argument callers, including deep-import consumers, are unaffected.
- Offline fallback permalinks deliberately keep the shared compat and no `thinkingLevelMap`: without a catalog row there is no way to know the alias's current target, and a stale map would be a guess that can fail every request. They still set `reasoning: true`, so pi continues to display levels `off` through `high` for them; those selections simply emit no `reasoning_effort`. This is now documented rather than implied by a test comment that mislabeled four reasoning models as "non-reasoning".
- Live permalink resolution follows a re-point only when the new target is already in the verified override table. Those maps come from live probing and cannot be derived from `supported_features`, which reports that a model reasons but not which effort values it accepts. A re-point to an unprobed model leaves the permalink emitting no `reasoning_effort` until a release adds it.
- Re-pointed the `syn:large:vision` fallback entry from Kimi K2.7-Code to Kimi K3: 512K context (was 256K) and $3.00/$15.00 pricing (was $0.95/$4.00). Sessions pinned to the permalink pick this up automatically.
- Refreshed all fallback pricing and context windows against the live `always_on` catalog as of 2026-07-28. `syn:large:text` and GLM 5.2 drop to $1.00/$3.00 (were $1.40/$4.40).

### Deprecated
- `KIMI_K27_CODE_MODEL_ID` is deprecated but still exported with its original value. The model it names is gone, so it no longer appears in the fallback list or the reasoning-override table, but `extensions/` ships in the published package and removing the named export outright would break deep imports. Use `KIMI_K3_MODEL_ID`, or the `syn:large:vision` permalink that Synthetic re-pointed to K3.

### Removed
- Removed `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code` from fallback models and from the reasoning-override table. Synthetic retired it from the catalog alongside the K3 launch, earlier than the launch announcement suggested.

### Fixed
- `syn:*` permalinks now receive their target model's reasoning-effort overrides during live catalog discovery, resolved through the row's `hugging_face_id`. Previously every permalink fell through to the shared compat with `supportsReasoningEffort: false`, so pi still displayed thinking levels — `reasoning: true` makes `off` through `high` selectable without a `thinkingLevelMap` — but the OpenAI-completions transport emitted no `reasoning_effort` for any of them. Every level, including `off`, silently left the model at Synthetic's server-side default. Live probes of all four permalink routes confirm an alias behaves exactly like its target, including `syn:small:text` inheriting GLM-4.7-Flash's HTTP 400 rejection of `max`.
- `REASONING_OVERRIDES` is now a `Map`. As a plain object, a catalog id of `constructor`, `toString`, or similar resolved an inherited property to something truthy, which would then be spread into a model config.
- Fallback `cacheRead` prices now use the catalog's `input_cache_reads` rate instead of mirroring the input price. Every fallback entry was affected. On `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2`, an entry that already existed in 1.2.1, cached reads were billed at $1.40 rather than $0.16 — a ~8.75x cost-tracking overstatement whenever the fallback path was in use. Live catalog discovery already read the correct field, so only fallback sessions were affected.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Declared the direct `@earendil-works/pi-tui` peer dependency used by the interactive model selector and quota commands, validated against Pi 0.80.9.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Thinking-level support for all six Synthetic reasoning models ([#23](https://github.com/ben-vargas/pi-packages/pull/23), follow-up to [#21](https://github.com/ben-vargas/pi-packages/issues/21)). Per-model `thinkingLevelMap` values were verified against 37 live probes of Synthetic's chat completions endpoint:
  - `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` and `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B`: `off` → `none`, `medium` → `medium`, `high` → `high`, `xhigh` → `max`.
  - `hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash` and `hf:nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4`: same, minus `xhigh` — their backends reject `reasoning_effort: "max"` with HTTP 400.
  - `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code`: `medium`/`high`/`xhigh` (→ `max`) only; `none`/`low` leak raw `</think>` tags into message content, so `off` stays hidden.
  - `hf:MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3`: `medium` only; no probed value disables its reasoning, so `off` stays hidden.
  - `low` and `minimal` are hidden on all six: the provider-side `low` value verifiably *disables* reasoning on GLM-5.2, GLM-4.7-Flash, Qwen3.6-27B, and Nemotron, so mapping pi's `low` to it would silently behave like `off`.

### Changed
- `reasoning: true` is now pinned on all six reasoning overrides (previously GLM-5.2 only), so a live catalog row missing `supported_features` can no longer silently disable effort emission for the other five models.
- Supersedes two 1.1.16 claims that live probing disproved: Synthetic *does* support disabling GLM-5.2 reasoning (`reasoning_effort: "none"`), so `off` is now selectable, and pi's `low`/`medium` no longer collapse to `high` — `medium` maps to `medium` directly.

## [1.1.17] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Refreshed the hardcoded Synthetic fallback catalog from the live `/openai/v1/models` endpoint: added `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code`, removed stale direct fallbacks that are no longer always-on, and updated current model metadata for MiniMax M3 and GPT OSS 120B.

## [1.1.16] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Thinking-level support for `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` ([#21](https://github.com/ben-vargas/pi-packages/issues/21)): pi's thinking levels now map onto GLM's supported `reasoning_effort` values (`low`/`medium`/`high` → `high`, `xhigh` → `max`). `off` and `minimal` are hidden — Synthetic has no documented way to disable GLM reasoning, and omitting the field would silently run at GLM's `max` default, so the lightest selectable level is `low` (sends `high`). Applied on both the live-catalog and fallback registration paths via a new per-model compat override, which also pins `reasoning: true` so a live catalog row missing `supported_features` cannot silently disable the effort mapping; all other Synthetic models keep the shared compat until their native thinking parameters are verified through Synthetic's proxy.

## [1.1.15] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- Fetch and register Synthetic models during extension startup so saved defaults and enabled/scoped Synthetic models are available before pi resolves the startup model.
- Added a three-second timeout for Synthetic model catalog fetches and fall back to hardcoded models when the live catalog is unavailable or filters to no supported models.

### Changed
- Kept the session-start model refresh path aligned with startup registration by re-registering the provider with either live models or fallback models.
- Refreshed the hardcoded Synthetic fallback catalog from the authenticated `/openai/v1/models` endpoint.

## [1.1.14] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Updated Synthetic provider registrations to reference `$SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` so pi resolves the environment variable instead of using a literal API key.

### Changed
- Raised the pi coding-agent peer dependency floor to 0.77.0.

## [1.1.13] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Updated pi SDK imports and peer dependency from `@mariozechner/*` to `@earendil-works/*` for pi 0.74.0.

## [1.1.12] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Replaced the hardcoded `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` fallback with `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`.
- Updated Kimi K2.6 fallback pricing to match the Synthetic catalog: $0.95 input / $4.00 output per million tokens.
- Updated extension usage comments and fallback tests for the Kimi K2.6 default.

### Fixed
- Corrected the fallback Kimi lineup to match the intended hardcoded defaults by removing the nonexistent `hf:nvidia/Kimi-K2.6-NVFP4` fallback.

### Removed
- Removed `hf:nvidia/Kimi-K2.5-NVFP4` from hardcoded fallback models. It can still appear from live Synthetic model discovery when available.

## [1.1.11] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Added `hf:nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4` and `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.1` to fallback models.

### Removed
- Removed `hf:MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.1`, `hf:zai-org/GLM-5`, and `hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7` from fallback models (no longer always-on).

### Changed
- Updated fallback pricing to match current Synthetic API rates:
  - `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5`: $0.45 input / $3.40 output (was $0.55/$2.19)
  - `hf:nvidia/Kimi-K2.5-NVFP4`: $0.45 input / $3.40 output (was $0.55/$2.19)
  - `hf:MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5`: $0.40 input / $2.00 output (was $0.60/$3.00)

## [1.1.10] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Added `hf:zai-org/GLM-5` to fallback models so the provider exposes the new always-on model before the live catalog refresh completes and when the Synthetic API is unavailable.

### Docs
- Refreshed Synthetic provider docs/comments/tests to reflect GLM-5 availability and current fallback metadata.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Updated the `session_start` live provider refresh path to use `pi.registerProvider(...)`, keeping Synthetic model refresh aligned with current pi runtime behavior.
- Updated `/synthetic-quota` to recognize Synthetic's hybrid and enhanced quota payloads, prioritizing rolling five-hour and weekly token limits ahead of search usage for newer accounts.
- Increased quota percentage precision in the overlay from one decimal place to two decimals for closer parity with the Synthetic website.

### Fixed
- Hid empty zero-limit tool-call buckets such as `freeToolCalls: { limit: 0, requests: 0 }` when the feature is not enabled.
- Fixed `/synthetic-quota` overlay dismissal so `Esc`, standard `Enter`, and keypad `Enter` all close the window consistently across terminal input modes.

### Docs
- Documented `/synthetic-quota` in the package README and added notes covering newer Synthetic quota systems and current pi compatibility expectations.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Added `hf:MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` to fallback models for early provider registration.

### Fixed
- Mitigated startup scoped-model warnings for `synthetic/hf:MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` when `enabledModels` are resolved before `session_start` live model refresh.
- Updated fallback metadata/docs/tests for the new MiniMax M2.5 fallback entry.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- Refactored monolithic `extensions/index.ts` (945 lines) into focused modules: `types.ts`, `config.ts`, `formatting.ts`, `models.ts`, `auth.ts`, `quota.ts`, and `commands/` handlers
- Main `index.ts` is now a thin orchestrator that re-exports public symbols and registers the provider, events, and commands

### Added
- New `commands.test.ts` with 15 tests covering interactive command handler flows: guard clauses, TUI overlay rendering, model selection/switch, cancel-close, and error handling
- Total test count increased from 48 to 63 across the project

## [1.1.6] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- Adjusted `/synthetic-models` overlay anchoring/offset so the modal opens higher (top-centered), matching `/synthetic-quota` behavior on typical terminal sizes.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- Updated `/synthetic-quota` parsing to support Synthetic’s current `/v2/quotas` response key `freeToolCalls` in addition to older `toolCallDiscounts` payloads.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Added `/synthetic-quota` command to display Synthetic API quota usage from `/v2/quotas`
- Added a themed interactive quota overlay with progress bars and color-coded usage states
- Added helper utilities for quota display formatting and usage coloring

## [1.1.3] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Redesigned `/synthetic-models` as an interactive, bordered overlay catalog instead of raw terminal log output
- Added direct model switching from the catalog: pressing `Enter` now sets the active model immediately
- Added responsive overlay sizing/placement for smaller terminals (dynamic width/height/offset behavior)
- Added datacenter location display with full country names (for example, `United States (US)`)

### Changed
- Prioritized Synthetic-hosted models in the catalog sort order (shown before other providers)
- Improved catalog row alignment with fixed-width columns and clearer headers

### Fixed
- Fixed `/synthetic-models` overlay rendering clashes with the footer/status area caused by raw `console.log` output
- Fixed details panel crash when `context_length` or `max_output_length` is missing in API responses
- Clarified cache pricing label in table header as `R-Cache`

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Added CHANGELOG.md to track version history
- Added datacenter locations section to `/synthetic-models` output for Synthetic-hosted models
- New `datacenters` field in `SyntheticModel` interface to capture API-provided location data

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Added `hf:nvidia/Kimi-K2.5-NVFP4` to fallback models (NVIDIA FP4 quantized variant)

### Fixed
