# pi-packages

These are packages built for my personal use and shared with the community of [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) in case it helps others.

Pi packages can include extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes. See the [pi packages docs](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md) for details.
